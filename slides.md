## Estimates are a tool
Speaker: 
Like all tools they have their used but they can be misused and abused. 

To often we use estimates for all the wrong reasons. 
We do them because we always have. 
Because we're caught up in big A agile and it says we have to.
Because a manager said we need to. 

Then these estimates are then taken as a commitment. 

Estimate accuracy is used as a KPI.  We know that measures used as target it ceases to be a good measure. So estimates are padded.  And now we see estimates as fiction and obviously the answer is simple.

# #NoEstimates
Speaker:
Thow out the estimates. Right? 

 #Noestimates has been popping up in my Tiwtter feed once again. 
 No estimates sounds really good when you hear someone like Woody Zuill talk about it.  He speaks of a pure and unadulterated agile.  Delivering only the most important and useful features quickly and with low over head.  Sounds brilliant, and if you can make it work, good on you.  Unfortunately I think it's a unicorn, aka not achievable by any given team. 

 Even if it was what I hear from every day developers is very different to what Woody Zuill has to say no estimates. It's less pure agile and much more of Estimates are hard so lets give up on them. 

 Giving up just because something is hard has never really been good enough. In the case of estimates not giving up 

* Woody Zuiel vs the Evangalist
* Unrealistic 
* If you dont estimate someone else will. 
* You might as well get involved.

If you don't estimate your work,

Someone else will.

## Communication


Speaker:

Why should you not give up on estimates. 
Estimates are a about communication.  
They're about building a shared understanding between the people that need the work done, the business stake holders, and the people that are giong to do the work, the Development team. 

Estimation as part of the communication startegy around pre project planning and project inception can help you to prevent the idea that it is "Just a website, my neighbours kid makes websites" and that idea that the business can order apps like pizza.  I'll have one web app with a sprinkle of PWA please.

Estimation is a key chance for us to communicate the complexity and intricasy of a solution to the business.

## Why are you estimating?

Speaker:

A key component to keeping estimates lean is making sure that you understand why you're estimating.

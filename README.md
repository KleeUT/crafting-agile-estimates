# Crafting Agile Estimates
Slides for the presentation

## Synopsys
Estimates are difficult for all parties involved. Too many missed deadlines have caused business’ to mistrust them. Being told that estimates are too high and to come back with a lower number only to have the estimate treated as a commitment, or being held to estimates done months before by other developers only to have no idea what considerations went into crafting the estimate has lead to development teams dreading them. This is symptomatic of a breakdown in communication that leaves an aftertaste of resentment in the mouths of both parties. 

For some the answer has been to throw out estimates out the window. This doesn’t address the lack of collaboration between the teams and stakeholders and leaves developers out of discussions about what is achievable by their team. 

This talk will show how development teams can leverage the trivariate estimation technique to provide more accurate estimates and facilitate meaningful communication with business stakeholders, project and developer managers. This meaningful conversation can lead to lower estimates and development costs without cutting features or quality.
